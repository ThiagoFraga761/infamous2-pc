"""Let native code take over lifted PPU code (port/ppu_native.cpp).

A post-pass over the lifter's output, the PPU twin of lift_spu.py's
add_native_entries. Two kinds of patch:

Native entries (NATIVE_ENTRIES). The entry of each listed function gets

    PPU_NATIVE_HOOK(0x005DEF90u);

before anything else in its body -- with --local-regs, before the guest
registers are loaded into locals. The hook asks the runtime once, on the first
call, for the native function registered at that address (ppu_native_slot)
and caches the answer in a function-local static; after that it costs a load
and a branch. A native function that returns nonzero has done the guest
function's work and left the context as the guest's `blr` would (PPC64 ELF
ABI: r1, r2, r13-r31, f14-f31, v20-v31, cr2-cr4 kept, the return value in r3);
the lifted function then returns at once. One that returns 0 declines, and
the lifted body runs as if there were no hook.

Native blocks (NATIVE_BLOCKS). For a hot loop inside a function too big to
replace whole: C put in at one of its labels, working on the --local-regs
locals, that does what a whole run of the loop does and leaves every register
as the loop would. It falls through to the lifted loop when its fast path does
not apply. Each block names the lifted lines it was written against, and the
pass stops if the lift no longer has them.

Each chunk with a patch gets the definitions they use after its preamble. The
pass is idempotent and the lists are authoritative: a patch that left them is
taken out again. Only chunks whose text changes are written, so a rebuild
recompiles just those. A relift drops every patch (the lifter does not know
about them): scripts/lift.sh runs this after the lift.

PS3RECOMP_NATIVE_PPU=0 turns both off at run time (the compare mode, 2, is
for the entries; the blocks just run). --no-blocks leaves the blocks out.

Usage: work/tools/ppu_native_entries.py [--recomp DIR] [--check] [--no-blocks]
  --check   report what would change and exit 1 if anything would
